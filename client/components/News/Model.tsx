    description: `Imagine a future where refugees can reach safety, regardless of where they’ve fled from or the color of their skin. A future where people don’t have to risk their lives in search of a safe place to call home. Where they are welcomed with open arms. Waikato Refugee Forum is working to make this future a reality.

Instead of asking, “how can we feed and shelter more refugees longer?” Waikato Refugee Forum asks, “what are the long-term solutions that will enable refugees to lead healthy lives and become contributing members of society again?” Those are the solutions that Waikato Refugee Forum works to expand through our three tactics: direct services, field building, and systems change. We deal with the solutions side of refugee response rather than the emergency assistance side.

We partner with refugees who are stuck in the Waikato to which they’ve fled on their journey from vulnerability to self-reliance. We work with people to determine how they can use their skills and resources to reach their goals and we support them along the way.

Program 1
Resettlement and safety
Unfortunately, many refugees face life-threatening danger and can’t become self-reliant where they are. We help these people relocate to a safe, new country so that they can rebuild their lives. To do this, our staff work across Waikato and around New Zealand to identify refugees that need help and advocacy. We’ve also developed unique programs that reunite refugee families, and help people relocate for work and education opportunities.

Through our direct service work, we reach refugees who fall through the cracks of the humanitarian aid system. We develop innovative programs and demonstrate that they work. We then collaborate with organizations, the migration and governments to scale these solutions to reach refugees around the Waikato.

Waikato Refugee Forum has directly assisted over 100,000 refugees to access resettlement and other pathways to safety and has worked in partnership with others to guarantee access for thousands more.`,
